<p>After a long hiatus, I’m revisiting one of my very very old projects…. the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moyinoluwa.yorubawatchfaces">Yoruba Watch face app</a> which is actually a watch face <em>and</em> a mobile app with a home screen widget.</p>

<h5 id="june-25-2019">June 25, 2019</h5>

<p><img src="./assets/images/dfm.png" alt="dfm" /></p>

<p>At Zola Electric, we have started the process of splitting our app into dynamic features. As a result of this, we’ve been forced to have serious conversations about the structure of our app’s code and question a lot of our design decisions. The first step of the process - determining what features we wanted - was a bit easy for us because the code had already been grouped by features, but we found areas where we needed to rethink some of our implementation. This article (<a href="http://adavis.info/2019/06/dagger-multibinding-in-dynamic-feature-modules.html">Dagger Multibinding in Dynamic Feature Modules</a>) by <a href="https://twitter.com/brwngrldev">Annyce</a> explains one of such areas, where we had to update our process of handling Multibinding with Android Jobs.</p>

<p>I’m going to walk through the steps involved with converting one of the modules and all the pain points experienced. This doesn’t not take into account all of the decisions we had to make but gives a high level overview of the process for anyone looking to get started.</p>

<p>Here’s the second (and last) article in the series of Leveling Up as an Android Dev. This article covers more about the other levels, what to expect and stories from experts in the Android Dev community.</p>

<p>Chances are you were already a Software Engineer before switching to Android Development. You might also have learnt your first line of Kotlin solely in the bid to become an Android Developer. Regardless of how you started developing for Android, at some point, you’ll need to start thinking about advancing to the next stage in your career.</p>

<p>In this article, you’ll see the evolution of an Android developer - from Junior, to Intermediate, to Senior and then to Team Lead and beyond. You will learn about what to expect at each stage and gain more insight into how to level up to the next stage.</p>

<h5 id="feb-27-2019">Feb 27, 2019</h5>

<p><img src="./assets/images/devfest.png" alt="devfest" /></p>

<p>DevFests are annual developer conferences organized by Google Developer Groups (GDGs) around the world. As a co-organizer for GDG Lagos, I worked with three organizers and other amazing volunteers to organize DevFest Lagos in November last year where we hosted 2000 people to a full day of technical talks from live and remote speakers.</p>

<p>There is no one way to conduct a technical interview. People have often used the dreaded whiteboard interviews, take-home coding assignments and even reviewed existing code on Github. There is a lot of backlash against the whiteboard coding interview, understandably so, as that rarely portrays the day-to-day responsibility of the applicant.</p>

<h5 id="apr-30-2018">Apr 30, 2018</h5>

<p>One of the features Anko is most notable for is simplifying the process of creating layouts programmatically. Anko also offers some variations of some views such as the AlertDialog. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">indeterminateProgressDialog()</code> displays an AlertDialog with a progress dialog while a <code class="highlighter-rouge">selector()</code> displays an AlertDialog with a list of text items. Even with all these, sometimes we still need to create dialogs with custom views, and we might need to use those dialogs in multiple screens in our app.</p>

<p>We’ve been on the journey to upgrade our Android app, ZOLA, to Android O and we’ve finally made it to Android N. Thankfully, we have one more API level to go. We were making this journey all the way from API Level 23.</p>

<p>We might all have heard about the impending day of judgement, when new and existing Android apps will be required to target API level 26 or higher. While there are some shiny new developer things in Android O — downloadable fonts, adaptive icons etc., there are also some not so shiny things.</p>

<h2 id="book-review-remote-office-not-required">Book Review: “Remote: Office Not Required”</h2>
<h5 id="nov-30-2017">Nov 30, 2017</h5>

<p>I recently read Remote: Office Not Required by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. I thought it’d be great to see if I was working remotely the right way and pick up tips to improve if I wasn’t. I’ll be sharing a few thoughts from the book in this article. The two most important things which stood out to me and constantly reoccurred throughout all the chapters, sometimes indirectly, were trust and communication.</p>

<p>Our entire software team is structured around these as we don’t have constant remote surveillance. Everyone trusts the other to show up everyday and pick up the phone.</p>
