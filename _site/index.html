<h5 id="feb-27-2019">Feb 27, 2019</h5>

<p><img src="./assets/images/devfest.png" alt="devfest" /></p>

<p>DevFests are annual developer conferences organized by Google Developer Groups (GDGs) around the world. As a co-organizer for GDG Lagos, I worked with three organizers and other amazing volunteers to organize DevFest Lagos in November last year where we hosted 2000 people to a full day of technical talks from live and remote speakers.</p>

<p>At Zola Electric, we recently migrated completely off ButterKnife to Kotlin Android Extensions and this article shows the common use-cases we had.</p>

<p>There is no one way to conduct a technical interview. People have often used the dreaded whiteboard interviews, take-home coding assignments and even reviewed existing code on Github. There is a lot of backlash against the whiteboard coding interview, understandably so, as that rarely portrays the day-to-day responsibility of the applicant.</p>

<h5 id="apr-30-2018">Apr 30, 2018</h5>

<p>One of the features Anko is most notable for is simplifying the process of creating layouts programmatically. Anko also offers some variations of some views such as the AlertDialog. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">indeterminateProgressDialog()</code> displays an AlertDialog with a progress dialog while a <code class="highlighter-rouge">selector()</code> displays an AlertDialog with a list of text items. Even with all these, sometimes we still need to create dialogs with custom views, and we might need to use those dialogs in multiple screens in our app.</p>

<p>We’ve been on the journey to upgrade our Android app, ZOLA, to Android O and we’ve finally made it to Android N. Thankfully, we have one more API level to go. We were making this journey all the way from API Level 23.</p>

<p>We might all have heard about the impending day of judgement, when new and existing Android apps will be required to target API level 26 or higher. While there are some shiny new developer things in Android O — downloadable fonts, adaptive icons etc., there are also some not so shiny things.</p>

<h2 id="book-review-remote-office-not-required">Book Review: “Remote: Office Not Required”</h2>
<h5 id="nov-30-2017">Nov 30, 2017</h5>

<p>I recently read Remote: Office Not Required by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. I thought it’d be great to see if I was working remotely the right way and pick up tips to improve if I wasn’t. I’ll be sharing a few thoughts from the book in this article. The two most important things which stood out to me and constantly reoccurred throughout all the chapters, sometimes indirectly, were trust and communication.</p>

<p>Our entire software team is structured around these as we don’t have constant remote surveillance. Everyone trusts the other to show up everyday and pick up the phone.</p>
