## Well, hello there 👋🏾

![hello](./assets/images/mountain.jpg)

Moyinoluwa is a Software Developer currently focused on building for the Android Platform. She loves learning about new technologies and writes about them on Medium. She currently works as an Android Developer at Zola Electric and before then, she was an Android Developer at Swifta Systems and Services. She studied Computer Science with Mathematics at Obafemi Awolowo University and managed the Google Developers Group there for 3 years. She currently co-organizes the Google Developers Group in Lagos.

While she’s not doing any of these things you’ll probably find her with her nose in a good book, speaking at a developer event, learning German or trying to beat her personal best for a marathon.
