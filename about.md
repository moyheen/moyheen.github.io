Moyinoluwa Adeyemi is an Android Developer at Zola Electric. The team that she is a part of works on an app that enables people in Sub-Saharan Africa to have access to clean energy. Before Zola Electric, she was the sole Android Developer at Swifta Systems. She has a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with Mathematics from Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria.

Moyinoluwa loves learning and sharing her knowledge about Android Development at local and international events. She is also very involved with the developer community. She started the first Women Techmakers group in Nigeria at her university in 2013, managed the Google Developers Group there for 3 years and she was a co-organizer for the Google Developers Group in Lagos for almost four years. 

While she’s not doing any of these things you’ll most likely find her with her nose in a good book, speaking at a developer event, learning German or trying to beat her personal best for a marathon.

You can find her articles here, slides for her talks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/moyheen), or say hello on Twitter [@moyheen](https://twitter.com/moyheen).
